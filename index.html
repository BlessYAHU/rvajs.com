            Since its introduction a few short years ago, Google Chrome has become
            the preferred browser for web developers the world over. In this session,
            we'll dive into the primary reason for this fact, the Chrome Developer Tools.
            We'll show you how to leverage these tools to enhance your design and development
            process.  You'll learn how to navigate Chrome's numerous features, emulate
            various display settings, audit and improve page loads, and much more.

              <h3>Lessons Learned from Building a Large Angular App</h3>
              Brian McDaniel

              February 3, 2015
            </div>

            <p>
              Since October 2013, I've been working on an Angular app
              that's grown from 2,000 lines of code written mostly by a
              single developer to over 50,000 lines (including tests)
              worked on by a team of developers. Along the way, we've
              discovered plenty of bad practices and anti-patterns, and,
              occasionally, we've done some good things, too. In this
              talk, I'll share the things that worked, the things that
              didn't work, and some general tips for working with Angular.
            </p>

            <p>
              Since there have already been talks introducing Angular, this won't be
              a general introduction to the framework. In lieu of showing off
              Angular's data-binding with an ng-model tied to an input, we'll be
              digging into directives, testing, application architecture,
              performance, and more. That said, if you haven't ever used Angular, my
              hope is that you'll at least be able to see some of the ways in which
              Angular can be used to make large-scale app development easier.
            </p>

            <p>
              Appcelerator Titanium is a cross platform Mobile Application development framework that
              encourages code reuse and modular application design.  With Titanium, you can create
              apps that support multiple platforms without needing to know languages such as Java
              or Objective-C.  Titanium allows you to leverage the flexibility of a javascript based
              web framework while giving you access to the power and functionality of a native mobile
              application.  We will discuss Titanium basics, the Titanium Alloy MVC Framework,
              and the nuances associated with creating cross platform applications.

              He is a VCU graduate with a B.S. in Computer Science and has lived here in Richmond since
              2007.  While he is primarily a Mobile Applications Developer, he is a Web Developer at
              heart.  With over 15 years of web experience, he has witnessed the web evolve from
              framesets with animated gifs, and autoplaying MIDIs, to the elegant designs we see
              today.  Most recently he has been enjoying ditching PHP + SQL backends in favor of
              Node.js + mongoDB solutions.

              <h3>Web Components and the Future of JS Frameworks</h3>
              Brad Gignac <a href="http://twitter.com/bradgignac">@bradgignac</a><br/>

            <p>
              Over the last ten years, the web has given birth to hundreds of different Javascript libraries and
              frameworks, all aimed at making web application development quicker and easier. While these frameworks
              have let us build great web applications, they have left the web fragmented - frameworks represent a
              platform unto themselves with almost zero interoperability.
            </p>
            <p>
              Web components represent a cross-framework method for building composable, reusable widgets that work
              anywhere on the web, independent of any framework. This talk gives a technical overview of web components
              and discusses how they will impact the future of Javascript frameworks.

              <h3>So You Want to Build A Web App with node.js</h3>
              Kevin Griffin <a href="http://twitter.com/1kevgriff">@1kevgriff</a><br/>
              October 7, 2014

            <p>
              When the majority of people sit down with node.js for the first time, they often want to build
               some sort of web application. So how do you do that? You could always write the JavaScript by
               hand to directly access sockets, or you could use the HTTP connectors to pre-parse the incoming
                requests. Most people will pick up a framework, such as Express.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the past two years, I've built a lot of Express applications and have generated several
               opinions about the best way to structure an application for rapid development. In this talk, I
                would like to show you my step-by-step process for building a new Express infrastructure. We'll
                 cover configuration, file structure, authentication, and request management from a file and API standpoint.
              </p>

              Meteor is a new JavaScript application framework that promises to reduce the burdens of building
              single page applications.  In the words of one of its creators it is “designed to be fun for
              developers”. It does so by offering a unified stack of technologies all based on JavaScript to
              deliver a complete application from user presentation on the client to the server and database
              on the backend. At the same time, it incorporates push technologies that enable real-time updates
              from server to client. This session will explore the basics of Meteor and how to get started
              with building applications using this new framework.

            <p>
                      Let's talk about what it looks like to program in a
                      functional style
                      using <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">underscore</a>
                      in JavaScript. Underscore provides a collection of
                      useful methods for working with data in a functional
                      style. We will look at why this can be better than
                      doing things in an imperative style.
            </p>
            <p>
                      This will be a workshop, so bring your laptop! We
                      will work through several problems and see what it
                      looks like to solve them functionally.

              the same time being able to still enjoy some of the dynamic aspects of the
              JavaScript language? Have you ever wanted to be able to structure your team's
              large JavaScript application code into dynamically loadable modules? Have you
              ever wanted richer tooling for JavaScript that is closer to what you experience

			Negativity surrounds the concept of existing code. This negativity is baked into the language we use.
			We work on 'legacy projects', 'dirt field projects', 'rescue projects', 'antiquated projects', 'ancient
			projects'. I'd like to use the construction metaphor to look at these projects in a different light.
			I've been inspired by the TV program, 'This Old House'. I think the care and attention that's given
			existing structures while making them do more for their inhabitants is a great model for how we can
			treat our software projects. This talk isn't JavaScript specific; it's themes and guidance will apply
			to anyone who's worked on a  project that someone else left behind or anyone who is likely to do so in the future.

          I work at <a href="www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> as a
          Senior Web Engineer writing tools for webapps, focusing
          on <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/">Firefox
            OS</a>. I love doing everything in JavaScript: rich visual
          interactions, complex backend network infrastructure, etc.
          The speed of development and cross-platform support is
          amazing. I'm easily distracted by interesting ideas.

          <h3>Making Data Sexy with D3</h3>
          Tiffany France <a href="http://twitter.com/tiffylou">@tiffylou</a> <br/>

          </div>
          <p>
            In this talk we will look at D3, a JavaScript library for manipulating documents
            based on data. I will show several examples where D3 is being used, and then we
            will step through an elementary example, showing how to implement D3 on a site
            with fresh data.
          </p>

        <h3>Server Side JavaScript in Azure Mobile Services</h3>
        Kevin Hazzard <a href="http://twitter.com/kevinhazzard">@kevinhazzard</a> <br/>
        September 8, 2015
        </div>
        <p>
          Just a couple of years ago, if you had asked most developers which cloud computing platform would have a large-scale, successful server side JavaScript implementation, few would have chosen Microsoft. Yet, here we are. Microsoft's Azure Mobile Services product stands as one of the very best cloud-based Node.js powered products out there. Sometimes called a Mobile Backend As A Service (MBAAS), Azure Mobile Services gives you just about everything you need to connect any kind of mobile device to your infrastructure. And with the power of JavaScript in hand, the extensibility options are seemingly limitless. In this highly-interactive, code-focused session, we'll dive deep into the ways that JavaScript can be used on the server side to extend Azure Mobile Services in a variety of useful ways including logging, authorization, redirection, messaging, push notifications and more.

              Kevin Hennessy <a href="http://twitter.com/kevinmhennessy">@kevinmhennessy</a><br/>

              Meteor is a new JavaScript application framework that promises to reduce the burdens of building
              single page applications.  In the words of one of its creators it is “designed to be fun for
              developers”. It does so by offering a unified stack of technologies all based on JavaScript to
              deliver a complete application from user presentation on the client to the server and database
              on the backend. At the same time, it incorporates push technologies that enable real-time updates
              from server to client. This session will explore the basics of Meteor and how to get started
              with building applications using this new framework.

					<h3>Grokking Event-driven I/O with Node.js</h3>
					Kevin Hazzard <a href="http://twitter.com/kevinhazzard">@KevinHazzard</a><br/>
					October 7, 2014
				</div>
				<p>
					The event-driven programming model of Node.js feels natural to Ruby developers. However, if you don't
					have experience with other event- or message-oriented programming models, Node.js can be difficult to
					grok. In this discussion, we'll begin by understanding the cost of I/O in a typical, multi-threaded
					application. Then we'll seek to comprehend the threading and eventing models that Node.js uses to
					overcome code complexity while eliminating the need for costly I/O blocking mechanisms. Finally, we'll
					explore a few options for doing asynchronous processing in Node.js when you need that sort of thing.
					Please install Node.js on your laptop before the meeting. We'll spend some time during and after the
					discussion in hands-on exercises exploring a few concepts.
				</p>
				<p>
					Kevin has been developing software for 35 years, mostly in databases and in the middle tier. Over that
					time, he's worked commercially with C, C++, Java, C#, Python, Ruby and F#, loving each language for its
					distinctive beauty and expressiveness. For the next few years, he turns his attention to JavaScript as
					a language of choice for web developers who want to use the language of their browser in the cloud.

              James Long <a href="https://twitter.com/jlongster">@jlongster</a><br/>
              August 5, 2014
            </div>
            <p>
                      Let's talk about what it looks like to program in a
                      functional style
                      using <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">underscore</a>
                      in JavaScript. Underscore provides a collection of
                      useful methods for working with data in a functional
                      style. We will look at why this can be better than
                      doing things in an imperative style.
            </p>
            <p>
                      This will be a workshop, so bring your laptop! We
                      will work through several problems and see what it
                      looks like to solve them functionally.

              Have you ever wanted to have statically typed classes in JavaScript while at
              the same time being able to still enjoy some of the dynamic aspects of the
              JavaScript language? Have you ever wanted to be able to structure your team's
              large JavaScript application code into dynamically loadable modules? Have you
              ever wanted richer tooling for JavaScript that is closer to what you experience
              with C# tooling? If you answered YES to these questions, then this is the
              presentation for you. This demo-heavy session will show numerous features
              that allow you to quickly and easily write JavaScript code that will run in
              any browser, host, or OS!

			Negativity surrounds the concept of existing code. This negativity is baked into the language we use.
			We work on 'legacy projects', 'dirt field projects', 'rescue projects', 'antiquated projects', 'ancient
			projects'. I'd like to use the construction metaphor to look at these projects in a different light.
			I've been inspired by the TV program, 'This Old House'. I think the care and attention that's given
			existing structures while making them do more for their inhabitants is a great model for how we can
			treat our software projects. This talk isn't JavaScript specific; it's themes and guidance will apply
			to anyone who's worked on a  project that someone else left behind or anyone who is likely to do so in the future.

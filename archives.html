          <p>
            In this talk we will look at D3, a JavaScript library for manipulating documents
            based on data. I will show several examples where D3 is being used, and then we
            will step through an elementary example, showing how to implement D3 on a site
            with fresh data.

          <h3>Pragmatic RxJS - Simple Uses for Reactive JavaScript</h3>
          Jesse Warden <a href="http://twitter.com/jesterxl">@jesterxl</a> <br/>

            View the <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8xUu4uAO8rnbVBkd0l6M285aFk">Slides</a>
            and <a href="https://gist.github.com/JesterXL/d2f89ccb17b26574b233">Code</a> for this talk.
          </p>

          <p>
            Have you heard of Reactive Programming, the Reactive Manifesto, and Streams, yet
            have no clue why you would use them in JavaScript? Have you looked at the various
            RxJS packages and been overwhelmed? Have you wondered why the writers of the
            documentation seem overly excited about Array.map?
          </p>
          <p>
            Jesse has too.
          </p>
          <p>
            So he set out to find out how to use these tools in real-world projects without
            going "Full Clojure". As a consultant who works with various Enterprises who have
            coders from various skill sets, he has to be careful about technology choices,
            and keep a pragmatic approach in suggesting tech for clients to use & maintain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Come see Jesse share his simple uses for RxJS and Dart's Frappe for the client
            with Angular, server with Node, and games.
          </p>

          <p>
            We're going to take a look at React Native, explain the
            abstractions it provides, and play with an actual app.
            Depending on time, I'll show a few advanced things like
            writing custom Objective-C components.
          </p>

          <p>
            Jesse started developing with software back in the late 1990's using Macromedia Director to assemble training software for a stock trading company. Later he fell in love with Flash, and continued to build software for a variety of clients atop the Flash Player. As his projects grew in scope and responsibility, he dove head first into Adobe Flex and started his consulting career. As the mobile revolution happened, he used those same front-end architecture, development, and consulting skills for mobile applications using the JavaScript/HTML/CSS stack with whatever MV* architect was the most popular. He now works as an Technical Architect Manager at Accenture.
          </p>

          <p>
            He's spoken at conferences & user groups around the world, contributed to & tech edited multiple books, and consulted with a variety of clients from HBO, Disney, and IBM to name a few.

      		<h3>Why React Native is Different</h3>

      	  <p>
            There's a reason why React has gained so much momentum,
            and it's the same reason React Native is so interesting.
            Titanium, NativeScript, and other projects offer the
            ability to write native apps with JavaScript, but React
            Native has received special attention because it's unique
            in many ways. The paradigm it provides really offers the
            best of both worlds in a way nothing else has.

            <h3>Lessons Learned from Building a Large Angular App</h3>
            Brian McDaniel

            February 3, 2015
          </div>

          <p>
            Since October 2013, I've been working on an Angular app
            that's grown from 2,000 lines of code written mostly by a
            single developer to over 50,000 lines (including tests)
            worked on by a team of developers. Along the way, we've
            discovered plenty of bad practices and anti-patterns, and,
            occasionally, we've done some good things, too. In this
            talk, I'll share the things that worked, the things that
            didn't work, and some general tips for working with Angular.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since there have already been talks introducing Angular, this won't be
            a general introduction to the framework. In lieu of showing off
            Angular's data-binding with an ng-model tied to an input, we'll be
            digging into directives, testing, application architecture,
            performance, and more. That said, if you haven't ever used Angular, my
            hope is that you'll at least be able to see some of the ways in which
            Angular can be used to make large-scale app development easier.

            Appcelerator Titanium is a cross platform Mobile Application development framework that
            encourages code reuse and modular application design.  With Titanium, you can create
            apps that support multiple platforms without needing to know languages such as Java
            or Objective-C.  Titanium allows you to leverage the flexibility of a javascript based
            web framework while giving you access to the power and functionality of a native mobile
            application.  We will discuss Titanium basics, the Titanium Alloy MVC Framework,
            and the nuances associated with creating cross platform applications.

            Over the last ten years, the web has given birth to hundreds of different Javascript libraries and
            frameworks, all aimed at making web application development quicker and easier. While these frameworks
            have let us build great web applications, they have left the web fragmented - frameworks represent a
            platform unto themselves with almost zero interoperability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Web components represent a cross-framework method for building composable, reusable widgets that work
            anywhere on the web, independent of any framework. This talk gives a technical overview of web components
            and discusses how they will impact the future of Javascript frameworks.

            When the majority of people sit down with node.js for the first time, they often want to build
            some sort of web application. So how do you do that? You could always write the JavaScript by
            hand to directly access sockets, or you could use the HTTP connectors to pre-parse the incoming
            requests. Most people will pick up a framework, such as Express.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the past two years, I've built a lot of Express applications and have generated several
            opinions about the best way to structure an application for rapid development. In this talk, I
            would like to show you my step-by-step process for building a new Express infrastructure. We'll
            cover configuration, file structure, authentication, and request management from a file and API standpoint.

            Meteor is a new JavaScript application framework that promises to reduce the burdens of building
            single page applications.  In the words of one of its creators it is “designed to be fun for
            developers”. It does so by offering a unified stack of technologies all based on JavaScript to
            deliver a complete application from user presentation on the client to the server and database
            on the backend. At the same time, it incorporates push technologies that enable real-time updates
            from server to client. This session will explore the basics of Meteor and how to get started
            with building applications using this new framework.

			Negativity surrounds the concept of existing code. This negativity is baked into the language we use.
			We work on 'legacy projects', 'dirt field projects', 'rescue projects', 'antiquated projects', 'ancient
			projects'. I'd like to use the construction metaphor to look at these projects in a different light.
			I've been inspired by the TV program, 'This Old House'. I think the care and attention that's given
			existing structures while making them do more for their inhabitants is a great model for how we can
			treat our software projects. This talk isn't JavaScript specific; it's themes and guidance will apply
			to anyone who's worked on a  project that someone else left behind or anyone who is likely to do so in the future.
